Introduction:

x=	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|........|	|	|
	 0	  1   2   3			index
	 
	 
1.An Array is an indexed collection of fixed number of homogeneous data elements.
2.The main advantage of Array is we can represent huge number of values by using single variable
So that readability of  the code will be improved.
3.But the main disadvantage of the array is fixed in size
That is once we creates an array there is no chance of increasing or decreasing the size based on our requirement
hence to use array concept compulsory we should know the size in advance,which may not possible always

Array Declaration:
 	i)one Dimensional (1D) array declaration:
 		valid declarations:
 		int[] x;--------->Recommended(variable name separated from the data type)
 		int []x;
 		int x[];
 		
 		At the time of declaration we can't specify the size.otherwise we will get compile time error.
 	ii)Two Dimensional (2D) array declaration:
 		valid declarations:
 		int[][] x;
 		int  [][]x;
 		int x[][];
 		int[] []x;
 		int[] x[];
 		int []x[];
 		If you want to specify the dimension before the variable,that facility is applicable only for 
 		first variable in a declaration.if trying to apply for remaining variables  we  will get compile time error.
 		
 	iii)Three Dimensional (3D) array declaration:
 		valid declarations:
 		int[][][] a;
 		int [][][]a;
 		int a[][][];
 		int[] [][]a;
 		int [] a[][];
 		int [] []a[];
 		int[][] []a;
 		int[][] a[];
 		int [][]a[];
 		int []a[][];
 		
 Array Creation:
 	int[] a=new int[3];
 	1.object is created by new keyword.same array is created in java.So every array in java is an object.
 	2.object is created for class only.if array is an object means its belongs to class only.
 	eg.int array belongs to int array class.these classes are in language level.not programmer level
 	array class name for  1D=[I
 	array class name for 2D=[[I
 	
 	for every array type corresponding classes are avaialble.these classes are part of java language.not available to the programmer level
 	
 	ArrayType------------corresponding class name
 	int[]					[I
 	int[][]					[II
 	double[]				[D
 	short[]					[S
 	byte[]					[B
 	boolean[]				[Z
 	
 Rules:
 1)At the  time of Array creation,Compulsory we should specify the size.otherwise we will get compile time error.
 (see ArrayCreationSample.java:13-16)
 2)It is legal to have an array with size 0 in java
 (see ArrayCreationSample.java:18)
 3)If trying to specify the array size with negative int value then,we will get run time exception that Negative array size exception.
 (see ArrayCreationSample.java:20)
 4)to specify array size allowed data types are char ,byte,short,int
 (see ArrayCreationSample.java:202-28)
 5)The maximum allowed array size in java is 2147483647(max value of int data type)
  may be in this case we get out of memory issue(if sufficient memeory not available)
  the memory for 2147483647 is 2147483647(no of int values)*4 bytes(int size)=the memory may not be available in our system
  
 2D Array Creation: 
 2D array is a martix(group of rows and column)
 
 Matrix:
 
 4 students there.
 student 1 having 5 scores
 student 2 having 2 scores
 student 3 having 1 score
 student 4 having 3 scores
 
 	s1|__56__|_55__|_78__|_90__|_90__|	
 	s2|__67__|_60__|_memory waste__|_memory waste__|_memory waste__|
 	s3|__22__|__memory waste__|___memory waste_|__memory waste__|__memory waste__|
 	s4|___45_|_50__|_32__|__memory waste__|__memory waste__|
 	
 	With Matrix array may be the memory can be wasted.So SUn java introduced Arrays of Array concept
 Arrays of array:
 
 base Array Size 4(no of studentss1,s2,s3,s4)
 
 		|S1|S2|S3|S4|
 
 supplementary array
 s1-->|__56_|_55__|__78_|_90__|_90__|
 s2-->|_67__|_60__|
 s3-->|_22__|
 s4-->|_45__|_50__|__32_|
 
 No memory waste if using array of array
 
 
 In java 2D array not implemented by using matrix representation.Sun people followed array of arrays approach for multi dimensional array 
 creation.The main advantage of this approach is memory utilization will be improved.
 
eg1:
Memory structure
base array 2
1st base having 2 supplement array
2nd base having 3 supplement array 	
(See ArrayofArray.java 7-9)
base size we have to specify at the time of creation.

eg2:Array of array of Array
base size2
array of array:
1st array having size3
2nd array having size2

array of array of array:
1st of 1 st having 1
2nd of 1st  having size 2
3rd of 1st having size 3

2nd of 1st,2nd   having size 2
(see ArrayofArray.java 11-16) 

Array Initialization:

Once we create an array,every element by default initialized with default values.(int- 0)
whenever we are trying to print any reference variable,internally toString() method will be called.
which is implemented by default to return the string in the following form.className@HashCode in hexadecimal form.

if we are trying to perform any operation on null,then will get run time exception saying null pointer exception.

Once we create the array,every array element by default initialized with default values.
if we are not satisfied with default values,then we can override these values with our customized values

If we are trying to access array element with out of range index(wither positive or negative int value).Then will get run time exception saying,array index out of bounds exception


Array declaration,creation,initialization in single line:

1.We can declare,create and initialze the array in a single line.(short cut representation)
every java object created in heap memory only. 
2.we can use this shortcut for multi dimensional arrays also

10  20 30      40  50  60     70  80   90 100 110


If you want to use this shortcut compulsory we should perform all activities in a single line.
If we are trying to divide into multiple lines,we will get compile time error.(see ArrayInitinSingleLineSample.java 20-26)


Length VS length():

length variable:
length is a final variable applicable for arrays.
length variable represents size of the array
length() method:
Every method presents inside the final class always be a final method.we can't override the final class.String is final class so length() method inside the String class also final method
Length() method is a final method applicable for string objects.
length() method returns no of characters present in the String



length variable applicable for arrays but not for String objects where as length() method
applicable for String objects but not for arrays.

In multi dimensional arrays length variable represents only base size.but not total size
there is no direct way to find the total size(because  next level is not fixed)
indirect way to find the total size of an array-> see LengthDifferSample.java 27

Anonymous Array:

nameless array.An array without name is called anonymous array.
purpose:
instant use or one time use

sometimes we can declare an array without name such type of nameless arrays are called 
anonymous arrays.
The main purpose of anonymous array is just for instant use


we can create anonymous array as follows:
new int[]{10,20,30};--->valid

while creating anonymous arrays we cant specify the size.otherwise we will get compile time error
new int[3]{10,20,30};--->invalid

we can create multi dimensional anonymous array also
new int[][] {{10,20},{30,40}}---->valid

based on our requirement we can give the name for anonymous array then,
it is no longer anonymous.(see AnonymousArraySample.java 13)

see AnonymousArraySample.java 08
in the above example just to call sum method  we required an array.But after completing the summethod call,we are not using that array anymore.Hence for these 1 time requirement anonymous array is best choice

Array element assignments:
case1:
In the case of primitive type array as array elements we can provide any type which can be implicity promoted to declared type.
if it is int array -> char,byte,short and int is allowed
if it is float array-> char,byte,short, int ,long,float allowed

case2:
In the case of object type arrays as array element we can provide either declared type
object or its child class object

case3:
for interface type arrays as array element its implementation class objects are allowed.
Runnable interface--> implementation class(thread class)
See ArrayElementAssignSample.java 31


Array type-------------------------------allowed element types
primitive arrays						any type which can be implicitly promoted to declared type
object type arrays						either declared type or its child class objects are allowed
abstract class type arrays				its child classes are allowed
(number array)	
interface array type					its implementation class objects are allowed	


Array Variable Assignments:

case1:
element level promotions are not applicable at array level.
char element to int element--->acceptable
char array to int array--->not acceptable		
see ArrayVariableAssignmentSample.java 5-8


char ----> int  valid
char[]---->int[] invalid
int--->double valid
int[]---->double[] invalid
float---->int invalid
float[]--->int[] invalid
String--->Object valid
String[]--->object[] valid(child class type array can be promoted to parent type array)


but in the case of object type arrays,child class type array can be promoted to
parent class type array.see ArrayVariableAssignmentSample.java 10
Integer type array to number array
double type(child) array to NUmber Array(parent)

case2:
whenever we are assigning one array to another array internal elements wont be copied.
just reference variable will be reassigned.
see ArrayVariableAssignmentSample.java 14

case3:
whenever we are assigning one array to another array ,dimensions must be matched.
see ArrayVariableAssignmentSample.java 14
in the place of 1D int array ,we should provide 1D array only.
If we are trying to provide,any other dimension,then we will get compile time error

**whenever we are assigning one array to another array,both dimension and type should be matched.
but sizes are not required to match.**
